# [Examining the correlations between Individual Non-conscious Prioritization Speed (NPS) and visual perception](https://github.com/yuvalharr/yuvalharr.github.io.git)
#### My Cognitive Psychology Thesis involved the following:
Non-conscious prioritization speed (NPS) is an individual trait describing the speed in which visual stimuli tend to break suppression and enter consciousness. In two experiments (involving more than 200 participants) I demonstrated, for the first time, that individual NPS can account for differences between individuals in the way they perceive their visual environment. The full thesis disertation can be found [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHbzWVxbYOU8stQTAU1QyyJ63_4lYkLT/view).

* Developed and deployed online experiments using HTML and JavaScript. A shortened demonstration can be found [Here](https://3ldplsixld.cognition.run/)
* Prepared, cleaned, and tranformed raw data using R.
* Computed individual perception ability parameters using curve fitting (of inverse exponential function) to each individual's behavioral data.
* Explored and visualized data using descriptive statistical analysis.
* Found a significant correlation between NPS and various perception ability parameters.
* Visualized findings in support of conclusions, using ggplot2 (R statistical package). Example visualizations are shown below.

# [Examining gender differences in face prioritization for consciousness](https://github.com/yuvalharr/yuvalharr.github.io.git)
#### My BSc final project in cognitive sciences involved the following:
Because we become aware to only a small fraction of external stimuli, understanding the determinants of conscious experience is extremely interesting. Here I used a novel data-driven approach to explore gender differences in the determinants for consciousness of human faces. In a 100 participants study I uncovered physical facial dimensions capable of explaining the speed in which faces will reach conscious awareness. I showed strong evidence for a distinct difference in these dimensions between the two genders.

* Developed and deployed online experiments using HTML, JavaScript and AWS.
* Prepared, cleaned, and tranformed raw data using R.
* Explored and visualized data using descriptive statistical analysis.
* Deployed a data-driven approach for analysis. Used reverse correlation to model the facial-properties dimensions predictive of prioritization speed.
* Found statistically significant differences between males and females in their priority dimension.
* Visualized findings in support of conclusions, using ggplot2 (R statistical package). Example visualizations are shown below.
